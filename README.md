1. Create a Feed page (think Facebook news feed) using Django Framework
where users will be able to post messages and see the messages posted by
other users.
2. This app will be integrated with a login app. After successfully logging in or
registering, a user should be redirected to localhost:8000/feed, where the
feed is displayed.
3. Create the Messaging functionality for each user, Once you get the
messages functionality working, allow users to post comments for any
message.
4. Comments should be in a separate database (use mysql or sqlite) table
from messages.
5. Allow the user to delete his/her own messages. (CRUD)
6. Allow users to LIKE messages and comments.
7. Once done upload the code on github and share the link
